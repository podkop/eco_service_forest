* Timber production - sourcing of timber products from harvested trees.
* Non-timber products - collectable berries, mushrooms, and medicinal plants.
* Biodiversity conservation - providing the support for a wide range of species, especially endemic and/or threatened ones.
	* Havitat availability for vertebrate species.
	* Havitat availability for invertebrate species.
	* Havitat availability for plants.
	* Havitat availability for fungi,
	* Deadwood volume, serving as a proxy indicator for habitat availability for many fungi, invertebrate, as well as some vertebrate species.
* Carbon sink - mitigating global climate change by absorbing and/or storing atmospheric carbon dioxide in biomass and soils.
	* Carbon sequestration - absorbtion of carbon from the atmosphere.
	* Carbon storage - retention of carbon in a stable form.
* Environmental regulation - maintaining and regulating local environmental conditions, making them safer, healthier and more comfortable for humans.
	* Water purification - filtering water and clearing it of impurities through biological, chemical, and physical interactions in the soil and vegetation.
	* Flood control - reducing the velocity and volume of water output by absorbing and storing the excess rainfall and runoff.
	* Air quality Improvement - filtering pollutants and producing oxygen, enhancing air quality.
	* Local climate regulation - influencing local climate through the effect on albedo and evapotranspiration rate.
	* Soil protection - preventing soil erosion through plants' root systems.
	* Pest and disease regulation - mitigating pests and disease outbreaks through maintaining the ecological equilibrium.
* Cultural services - non-material benefits offered by the forest to humans, enhancing their well-being and cultural development.
	* Recreation and tourism.
	* Education.
	* Culture, spirit, and aesthetics.
